## Question Bank - Foundation Exam

### Question 1
*Anything that has value to the organization is known as?*

- a) CISO
- b) **Asset**
- c) Network
- d) Money

**Correct Answer:** b) Asset

*Explanation:* Anything that has value to the organization is considered an **asset**. Information is also considered an asset that drives business in today's networked environment.

Assets can include:
*   Software such as Windows and Oracle
*   Paper documents such as contracts and telephone lists
*   Supporting utilities such as VOIP, telephone, and backup power supply
*   Hardware such as servers, laptops, and PDAs
*   People such as HR managers and network engineers
*   Information such as voice messages

Utilities themselves do not carry information, but they support devices that do. Information can be static (e.g., stored on a hard disk) or being transmitted (e.g., via email). Whatever form the information takes, it must always be protected.

Access to assets should be authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements. An inventory of assets, including their owners, should be developed and maintained. The term ‘owner’ refers to the individual or entity with management responsibility for controlling the asset's security, use, development, and maintenance. The owner approves the risk level and the controls selected for protecting that asset.

---

### Question 2
*Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity:*

- a) Confidentiality
- b) Integrity
- c) Accountability
- d) **Availability**

**Correct Answer:** d) Availability

*Explanation:* The property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity is **availability**.

Availability is one of the three types of protection for information security, the others being confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Confidentiality** ensures that information is only accessed by those with a "need to know" and "need to do".
*   **Integrity** refers to the "accuracy" and "completeness" of information. It means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
*   **Availability** means that systems are accessible to authorised users when needed. This includes ensuring that computing systems that process information and the communication channels through which the information is sent are working correctly.

These three aspects are vital for business survival, as is the identification of information security requirements.

---

### Question 3
*Set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to establish policies and objectives and processes to achieve those objectives:*

- a) ISMS objective
- b) Policy statement
- c) **Management System**
- d) Statement of Applicability

**Correct Answer:** c) Management System (References/1)

*Explanation:* Based on the standard:

*   **a) ISMS objective:** An ISMS (Information Security Management System) objective is a desired outcome or goal related to information security that an organisation sets for itself. Objectives should be consistent with the information security policy, measurable, and take into account applicable requirements as well as results from risk assessment and risk treatment. **While ISMS objectives are a crucial component of the ISMS, they are not the entire set of interrelated or interacting elements themselves**. Objectives are what an ISMS aims to achieve.

*   **b) Policy statement**: A policy statement, specifically an information security policy, provides a framework for setting information security objectives and includes a commitment to satisfy requirements and to continually improve the ISMS. The policy is a documented information, communicated within the organization and available to interested parties. **A policy statement is an important part of a management system, but it does not encompass all the interacting elements needed to establish and achieve objectives**. It provides direction and commitment, but not the processes for implementation.

*   **c) Management System:** A management system is a framework of guidelines, policies, procedures, processes and associated resources aimed at ensuring an organisation meets its objectives. An ISMS is a type of management system that focuses specifically on information security. The ISMS includes processes and their interactions to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve information security within an organization.  **This is the most accurate answer, as a management system is indeed a framework of interacting elements designed to achieve objectives through policies and processes**.

    *   Key components of a management system include:
        *   **Policies:** Providing the direction and framework.
        *   **Objectives:** Defining what the organization aims to achieve.
        *   **Processes:** The activities and procedures to reach the objectives.
        *   **Resources:** What is needed to implement the processes.
        *  **Interactions:** The relationships between the various processes and elements.
        *   **Continual Improvement:** Regular monitoring and adjustments to ensure effectiveness.
        *   **Documentation:**  To ensure consistency and clarity.

*  **d) Statement of Applicability (SOA):** The SOA is a documented statement describing the control objectives and controls that are relevant and applicable to the organisation's ISMS. It includes the necessary controls, justifications for their inclusion, whether they are implemented, and justification for excluding any Annex A controls. The SOA is derived from the risk treatment process. **The SOA is a key document within an ISMS, but it's a result of the ISMS processes, not the complete set of interacting elements itself**. The SOA reflects the implementation of controls but not the framework that defines how these controls are chosen and managed.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is c) Management System, as this term most closely describes the set of interrelated or interacting elements designed to establish policies, objectives, and processes to achieve those objectives within an organisation.** The other options represent important components of the ISMS, but not the entire framework of interacting elements themselves.

### Question 4
*Non-fulfilment of a requirement is:*

- a) **Non-conformity**
- b) Non-repudiation
- c) Requirement
- d) Risk

**Correct Answer:** a) Non-conformity

*Explanation:* Non-fulfilment of a requirement is a **non-conformity**.

The standard describes nonconformity and its management within the context of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) as below:
*   When a nonconformity occurs, the organization must react to it, taking action to control and correct it and deal with the consequences.
*   The organization must evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of the nonconformity, reviewing the nonconformity, determining its causes, and determining if similar nonconformities exist or could potentially occur.
*   The organisation must implement any necessary actions, review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken, and make changes to the ISMS if necessary.
*   Corrective actions should be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.
*   Documented information should be available as evidence of the nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken, and the results of any corrective action.
*   Auditors should confirm that the organisation responds by finding nonconformity and requiring corrective action when ISO/IEC 27001 and ISMS requirements are not satisfied.
*   Nonconformity and corrective action includes taking action to correct the situation, examine the cause, and determine if other occurrences exist or potentially exist elsewhere, so that action can be taken to prevent recurrence.
*   The organisation’s response should cover evaluation of the action taken to confirm that the intended result was achieved, and evaluation of the ISMS to determine if changes are warranted to avoid future occurrences of similar nonconformities.
*   Documentation of the nonconformity, corrective action, and the results should be created and controlled in accordance with the requirements of documented information.
*   Nonconformities should be managed with corrections and corrective actions.

Other terms in the question mentioned:
*   **Non-repudiation** In law, non-repudiation is a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated"
*  A **requirement** is a need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory. It may be a business, legal, security or other kind of requirement. 
*   A **risk** is the effect of uncertainty on objectives and can be positive or negative. Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the likelihood of an event and its consequences.

### Question 5
*Overall process of risk identification, risk analysis  and risk evaluation:*

- a) Risk Management
- b) Risk Analysis
- c) **Risk Assessment**
- d) Risk Treatment

**Correct Answer:** c) Risk Assessment

*Explanation:* The overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation is known as **risk assessment**.

Here's a breakdown of the terms in the question, according to standard:

*   **Risk assessment** is the overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation.
    *   **Risk identification** is the process of finding, recognising and describing risks. It involves identifying risk sources, events, their causes and potential consequences. Risk identification can involve historical data, theoretical analysis, expert opinions, and stakeholder needs.
    *   **Risk analysis** is the process of understanding the nature of risk and determining its level. Risk analysis provides an input to risk evaluation and decisions on how risks should be treated. Risk analysis can be qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative.
    *   **Risk evaluation** is the process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude is acceptable or tolerable. It assists in making decisions about risk treatment.
*   **Risk management** consists of coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk. It encompasses risk assessment, risk treatment, risk monitoring, and risk review.
*  **Risk treatment** is the process of modifying risk. Risk treatment can involve avoiding the risk, taking or increasing risk to pursue an opportunity, removing the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk, or retaining the risk. Risk treatments that deal with negative consequences are sometimes referred to as “risk mitigation”, “risk elimination”, “risk prevention” and “risk reduction”. Risk treatment can also create new risks or modify existing risks.

Therefore, while risk analysis is a component of risk assessment, and risk management encompasses all of the processes, risk assessment is the correct answer to this question.

The standard also note the following points about risk assessment and its related processes:
*   Risk assessment should be a comparable and repeatable process.
*   Risk assessment should be performed at planned intervals or when significant changes occur.
*   The results of risk assessments should be consistent, valid and comparable.
*   Risk assessment should include the identification of risk owners.
*   Risk assessments must be documented.
*   The risk assessment process should be applied to identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the information security management system.
*  The risk assessment process should be used to identify risks that can create, enhance, prevent, degrade, accelerate, or delay the achievement of the organization's objectives, and should consider risks whether or not their source is under the control of the organization.
*   Risk assessments should be based on informed decisions.

In addition, the standard identifies a variety of standards and guides related to risk assessment including ISO 31000, IEC 31010, and ISO/IEC 27005.

### Question 6
*Person or group of people who directs and controls an organization at the highest level?*

- a) Steering Committee
- b) Board
- c) **Top Management**
- d) Management Representative

**Correct Answer:** c) Top Management

*Explanation:* The person or group of people who directs and controls an organisation at the highest level is **top management**. Top management has a crucial role in the implementation and maintenance of an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here’s a breakdown of the responsibilities and aspects of top management, as described in the sources:
*   **Leadership and Commitment**: Top management must demonstrate leadership and commitment to the ISMS by ensuring that information security policies and objectives are compatible with the organisation’s strategic direction. They should ensure that the ISMS requirements are integrated into the organisation’s processes, and that the necessary resources are available. They must also communicate the importance of effective information security and of conforming to ISMS requirements.
*   **Accountability and Authority**: Top management is responsible for assigning and communicating the responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant to information security. This includes ensuring that the ISMS conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 and reporting on the performance of the ISMS. Top management also remains accountable for the satisfactory completion of activities assigned to the organisation.
*   **Integration of ISMS**: Top management must ensure the integration of the ISMS requirements into the organisation's processes. This means that information security should be considered in all areas of the business, not as a separate function.
*   **Resource Provision**: Top management has to ensure the availability of resources for an effective ISMS, assessing resource needs during management reviews, and setting objectives for continual improvement.
*   **Management Reviews**: Top management must review the ISMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. These reviews must include a consideration of actions from previous reviews, changes in the internal and external context, feedback on ISMS performance, results of risk assessments, and opportunities for improvement.
*   **Culture and Environment**: Top management is responsible for creating a culture and environment that encourages people to work actively towards the goals of ISO/IEC 27001.

While the term ‘Management Representative’ is used in the sources, it is noted that this is not a requirement of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard, and that the responsibility for managing the ISMS can be assigned to an individual, shared by several individuals or assigned to a team. The sources also indicate that the individual or team managing the ISMS should have sufficient access to top management to keep them informed of the status and performance of the ISMS.

Therefore, the correct answer is **c. Top Management**.

### Question 7
*Processes and procedures for ensuring continued information security operations?*

- a) **Information Security Continuity**
- b) Business Continuity Plan
- c) Disaster Recovery Plan
- d) Business Impact Analysis

**Correct Answer:** a) Information Security Continuity (References/2)

*Explanation:* The question asks about processes and procedures for ensuring continued information security operations. Considering the options provided:

*   **a) Information Security Continuity** is a critical component that involves having processes, procedures and controls in place to ensure that information security is maintained during adverse situations. It requires a management structure that can prepare for and respond to disruptive events, nominating personnel to maintain security, and having plans for response and recovery. These plans must include how to maintain information security while managing a disruptive event. Also, it’s essential to verify that these implemented controls are valid and effective, testing their functionality, and ensuring they are reviewed and updated as necessary.
*   **b) Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** is a proactive plan designed to deliver service obligations during business disruptions. BCPs ensure business continuity and involve all business functions. This includes assessing BCP/DR scenarios to make sure that security controls are in place during disasters. The plan should be developed, implemented, and reviewed to restore the security of critical business processes following interruption or failure.
*   **c) Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** refers to the procedures designed to ensure that technology can recover from disruptions, as per business expectations.
*   **d) Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** relates specific risks and threats to their impact on key business issues. It is a starting point for business continuity planning and its results should guide the planning. The BIA process assesses impacts over time, identifies prioritized activities and assigns a recovery time objective (RTO). It also determines the necessary resources to support activities, such as ICT services, and defines the performance and capacity requirements of ICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO).

While all four options are related to ensuring operational resilience, they have different roles. Options b, c, and d contribute to the broader goal of maintaining business operations during disruptions but not necessarily information security operations alone. Option a, **Information Security Continuity**, directly addresses maintaining security during adverse conditions, therefore, it is the most correct answer on its own.

**Therefore, the most correct answer is a) Information Security Continuity.**

### Question 8
*Which of the following is an evidence of commitment and leadership in regard to the ISMS?*

- a) **Promoting continual improvement**
- b) Testing employees' knowledge and skills
- c) Implementing corrective action
- d) Auditing the ISMS

**Correct Answer:** a) Promoting continual improvement

*Explanation:* Of the options you've provided, **promoting continual improvement** is the most direct evidence of commitment and leadership in regard to the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here's why, based on the standard:

*   **Leadership and Commitment:** Top management is required to demonstrate leadership and commitment with respect to the ISMS. This includes promoting continual improvement.
*   **Continual Improvement:** The standard explicitly states that top management should promote continual improvement as part of their leadership responsibilities. This demonstrates an active engagement in enhancing the ISMS over time.
*   **Management Review:** Top management is responsible for reviewing the ISMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness, and this includes identifying opportunities for continual improvement.
*   **Actions for Improvement**: The organisation is required to continually improve the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the ISMS, taking actions based on audits, analysis of monitored events, and corrective actions.

While the other options are also important for an effective ISMS, they don't directly demonstrate leadership commitment in the same way:

*   **Testing employees' knowledge and skills** is a part of ensuring competence and awareness, but it is more about maintaining a baseline level of security rather than showing commitment from leadership.
*   **Implementing corrective action** is a necessary response to nonconformities, but it is more about addressing problems than showing proactive commitment to improvement.
*   **Auditing the ISMS** is a key part of the performance evaluation and provides information on whether the ISMS conforms to requirements and is effectively implemented. Although this is an important activity, it is not a direct demonstration of leadership commitment in the same way as actively promoting and implementing improvements.

Therefore, while all of these are important activities within an ISMS, **promoting continual improvement** is the one that specifically demonstrates leadership and commitment.

### Question 9
*What does the management review include?*

- a) **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives**
- b) Detection of non-conformities
- c) Implementing corrective actions
- d) Discipline of non-complying employees

**Correct Answer:** a) Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most appropriate single answer to your question about what a management review includes is: **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives**.

Here's why:

*   **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives:** The sources explicitly state that a management review includes "feedback on the information security performance, including trends in... fulfilment of information security objectives". This is a core component, ensuring that the ISMS is meeting its intended goals.
*   **Other Included Items**: While other options you provided are related to the ISMS, they are either components of, or are supported by, the information security objective. For example, detection of nonconformities and implementing corrective actions are parts of the feedback loop that informs the management of the ISMS, but the review is ultimately focused on whether the objectives are being met.

Here is more detail about what a management review includes:

*   **Status of Actions from Previous Reviews:** Reviews the progress of actions from prior meetings.
*   **Changes in Context:** Considers changes in external and internal issues relevant to the ISMS.
*  **Needs of Interested Parties**: Takes into account the needs and expectations of interested parties.
*   **Feedback on Information Security Performance:** Includes trends in nonconformities and corrective actions, monitoring and measurement results, audit results, and the fulfilment of information security objectives.
*   **Risk Assessment and Treatment:** Reviews the results of risk assessments and the status of the risk treatment plan.
*   **Opportunities for Continual Improvement:** Identifies opportunities for improvement of the ISMS.

Therefore, while detection of non-conformities and implementing corrective actions are part of the ISMS processes and are considered during a management review, the **fulfilment of information security objectives** is the most direct and central element of the management review according to the sources. The discipline of non-complying employees is not specifically mentioned as a direct component of a management review.

### Question 10
*An information security risk is?*

- a) The potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation
- b) The impact of a threat on Information Security
- c) **The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability**
- d) A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats

**Correct Answer:** c) The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, an information security risk is best defined as **the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability**.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Risk Defined:** A risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. It is the potential for something to go wrong, and it includes the possibility of both positive and negative outcomes. In the context of information security, it is the potential for loss or damage.
*   **Risk Components:** Information security risk arises from the interaction of several components:
    *   **Threat:**  A threat is anything that can harm an information asset, and can be man-made or a natural event.
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited to harm an information asset.
    *   **Impact**: The potential consequences that would result if a risk were to materialize.
*   **How Risk Occurs:** A risk materializes when a threat exploits a vulnerability, leading to a potential negative impact, such as loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Risk assessment involves several steps, which include identifying the risks, analysing potential consequences and the likelihood of those consequences and then evaluating the results against risk criteria.
*   **Risk Treatment**: After risks have been assessed, actions are taken to modify the risk by selecting appropriate options and implementing necessary controls.

Let's consider the options you provided, based on the sources:

*   **"The potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation"** This describes a **threat**, not a risk itself. A threat is a potential source of harm, but it does not represent the overall risk.
*   **"The impact of a threat on information security"** While impact is a component of risk, it is not the full definition of a risk. A risk includes both the likelihood of an event and its impact.
*   **"A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats"** This is the definition of a **vulnerability**.  A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit, but the risk is what happens if the vulnerability is exploited.

Therefore, the most accurate definition of an information security risk is:  **the potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.** This captures the combined effect of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and leading to a potential negative consequence, which is at the core of understanding information security risk.

### Question 11
*Top management must assign and communicate?*

- a) **Responsibilities and Roles for Information Security**
- b) Corrective Action to Security Team Members
- c) ISMS review tasks to the System Administrator
- d) Non-Conformities found during Audit

**Correct Answer:** a) Responsibilities and Roles for Information Security

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, top management must assign and communicate **responsibilities and roles for information security**.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the most accurate answer, with references to the sources:

*   **Responsibilities and Authorities:** Top management is explicitly required to ensure that the responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant to information security are assigned and communicated. This includes assigning the responsibility and authority for ensuring the ISMS conforms to the requirements of the standard and for reporting on the performance of the ISMS to top management.

*   **Communication of Roles:** The sources emphasize that these responsibilities and authorities must not only be assigned but also communicated. This ensures that all individuals involved in the ISMS understand their roles and obligations. Top management should ensure the responsibilities and authorities are communicated in accordance with the requirements of the communication clause (7.4).

*  **Not just one person**: The role of ensuring the management system conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 can be assigned to an individual, shared by several individuals or assigned to a team.

Let's examine the other options you provided and why they are not the primary responsibility that top management must assign and communicate, according to the sources:

*   **Corrective action to security team members**: While corrective actions are a part of the ISMS, the assignment of these actions to specific team members is a downstream activity that may follow an audit or non-conformity detection. The top management's primary responsibility is to establish the overall ISMS and to assign roles and responsibilities, not to assign specific corrective actions to individual team members. The sources do state that when a nonconformity occurs, the organisation shall react to it, take actions to control and correct it, and deal with the consequences. The organisation should evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of nonconformity. This is a process that would be followed based on the identification of non-conformities, and not something that would be assigned on a regular basis by the top management.

*   **ISMS review tasks to the system administrator**: While system administrators may be involved in ISMS activities, assigning specific review tasks is more of a delegation of duties. Top management's key action is to ensure that there is a person, or team, responsible for the ISMS itself. Top management has to also ensure that the ISMS achieves its intended outcome, by supporting the implementation of all information security management processes and in particular, through requesting and reviewing reports on the status and effectiveness of the ISMS. The management review itself is driven by top management, not by a system administrator.

*   **Non-conformities found during audit**: Top management must ensure that the responsibilities for implementation of the ISMS are assigned to roles, and that top management is accountable for these responsibilities. Top management also needs to make sure that the performance reporting is conducted in accordance with the requirements of the management review. However, while the management review will take into account non-conformities found during audits, top management do not need to directly assign and communicate these.

In summary, while all of the other options are related to the operation of an ISMS, the most direct and fundamental requirement for top management is to **assign and communicate responsibilities and roles for information security.** This sets the foundation for the rest of the ISMS processes.

### Question 12
*Which of the following is part of the Risk Treatment Plan?*

- a) Which controls to implement
- b) What are the resources to implement the security controls
- c) What are the deadlines of the security controls implementation
- d) **All of the Above**

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the Above

*Explanation:* Based on the provided sources, the most accurate answer is **all of the above** are part of a risk treatment plan.

Here's why, with a detailed breakdown:

*   **Risk Treatment Plan Components:** A risk treatment plan is a crucial document that outlines how an organisation will modify identified risks. It includes:
    *   **The risk being addressed**:  The specific risk that the plan is designed to mitigate, and its level according to the assessment.
    *  **Actions to treat the risk**: The actions proposed to modify the risk, which includes selecting appropriate controls to implement.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Clearly defines who is in charge of implementing the proposed actions.
    *   **Resources**: Outlines the necessary resources (e.g., budget, personnel, tools) required to implement the controls.
    *   **Timeframe:** Specifies the deadlines for the implementation of the risk treatment actions and controls.
    *  **Implementation Status:** Indicates whether the necessary controls are implemented or not.
    *  **Expected Benefits**: Explains the reasons for selection of treatment options, including the benefits to be gained.
   *  **Performance Measures:** Includes performance measures and constraints.
    * **Reporting and Monitoring:** Includes a method of reporting and monitoring the implementation of the plan.
*   **Controls Selection:** The risk treatment plan includes the selection of appropriate information security risk treatment options, taking into account risk assessment results. This involves determining **which controls to implement**. The risk treatment plan should be formulated from the outputs of the risk assessment. The chosen controls should be compared with those in Annex A of the standard, in order to verify that no necessary controls have been omitted.
*  **Resource Allocation**: A risk treatment plan includes the resources needed for the plan's implementation, such as finances, personnel, and technology. This includes determining **what are the resources to implement the security controls**.
*   **Deadlines for Implementation:** The plan includes defined timeframes and schedules for implementing the selected controls and actions. This answers **what are the deadlines of the security controls implementation**. The risk treatment plan should also link to or include the implementation status of necessary controls.
*  **Approval of Risk Owners**: The risk treatment plan needs to be approved by the risk owners, who are also responsible for accepting the residual risk after the plan is implemented.

Therefore, all of the options you listed — **which controls to implement, what are the resources to implement the security controls, and what are the deadlines of the security controls implementation** — are indeed essential components of a comprehensive risk treatment plan as defined in the sources.

### Question 13
*Which of the following is a statement of a top level information security policy?*

- a) **Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it**
- b) Install anti malware on all organisation computers
- c) Encrypt sensitive data transiting in the company network
- d) Do not allow teleworking

**Correct Answer:** a) Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it

*Explanation:* Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the statement that best represents a top-level information security policy is: **ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it**.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the most accurate answer, with references to the sources:

*   **Top-Level Policy Characteristics:** A top-level information security policy should be broad, setting the overall direction and principles for information security within the organisation. It should outline the organisation's commitment to information security and provide a framework for setting more specific security objectives. It is not meant to be overly detailed or technical. The sources also note that the policy should be appropriate to the purpose of the organisation and not too generic. It should also include a commitment to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements and a commitment to continual improvement.

*   **"Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it"**: This statement aligns with the core principle of **confidentiality**, which is a key element of information security. It is a high-level statement of intent that sets the direction for access controls and related security measures, without getting into the specifics. It defines a broad objective that can be further broken down into more detailed policies and controls. A top-level policy like this would normally be supported by more specific topic-based policies, such as a policy on access control.

Let's examine the other options you provided and why they are more likely to be specific controls or topic-specific policies, rather than top-level information security policies:

*   **"Install anti-malware on all organisation computers"**: This is a specific **technical control** that would be part of a more detailed policy or procedure, likely under the area of malware protection. It's an action that supports the overall goal of information security, but it's too specific to be a top-level policy statement. Top-level policies are more about "what" and "why", while specific controls are about "how". The sources indicate that a high-level policy should be supported by topic-specific policies that mandate the implementation of information security controls.

*  **"Encrypt sensitive data transiting in the company network"**: This statement, while important, refers to a specific **technical security measure** related to network security and cryptography. It is a control that would be part of a more detailed policy on data protection or network security. A top-level policy would not specify a particular method of protecting the data; instead, it would specify the overall need to protect it. The use of cryptography is a control that an organisation can adopt, but not necessarily one that they must adopt, so it would not be something that should be included in a top level policy statement.

*   **"Do not allow teleworking"**: This is a specific **rule** that an organisation might implement as part of their security measures, likely covered by a mobile device and teleworking policy. This type of statement is too narrow and restrictive to be a top-level policy. It limits the operational practices of the organisation, and doesn't define a security goal or objective. The sources suggest that a topic-specific policy on teleworking should exist if it is allowed, and if not, then that would be part of overall security requirements.

In summary, a top-level information security policy is meant to be a guiding principle that sets the tone for all information security activities within the organisation, as well as being appropriate for the purpose of the organisation. While the other options are relevant to information security, they are specific controls, rules or practices, rather than high-level strategic statements. Therefore, the statement **"ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it"** best represents a top-level information security policy.

### Question 14
*Complete the Sentence: An information security incident is a security ____ that have a significant probability of compromising information security.*

- a) Breach
- b) Vulnerability
- c) Threat
- d) **Event**

**Correct Answer:** d) Event

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most accurate completion of the sentence is: An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security.

Here's why, with a detailed explanation drawing from the sources:

*   **Information Security Event vs. Incident:** The sources make a clear distinction between security events and security incidents. A security event is any **observable occurrence** in a system or network, which could potentially indicate a breach or a problem. This can include a wide range of occurrences, such as:
    *   Ineffective information security controls
    *   Human errors
    *   A virus detected on a system
    *   Breaches of physical security
    *   Passwords being exposed
    *   Hardware or software malfunctions
    *   Uncontrolled system changes
    *   Unauthorised access
    *   Non-compliance with policies or legal requirements

    An information security incident, on the other hand, is a security event that is determined to **have a significant probability of compromising information security**. In other words, not all security events are classified as incidents; only those that meet specific criteria. An organisation must assess the events and decide if they are to be categorised as incidents.

*   **Why "event" is the correct choice:** The completed sentence is "An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security." This wording reflects the hierarchical relationship described in the sources, where an incident is a type of security event, not a breach, vulnerability, or threat. The assessment of security events is an essential step in determining if an incident has occurred.

*   **Why other options are not the best fit**:
    *   **Breach:** A breach is a specific type of incident where security has been violated. A security event that has a high probability of causing a breach would be considered an incident. So "breach" is not the best fit.
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat. While a vulnerability can lead to an incident, it is not the incident itself. So, "vulnerability" is not the best fit.
    *   **Threat:** A threat is something that can cause harm to an asset, such as a virus or a hacker. It is the cause, not the event. So, "threat" is not the best fit.

Therefore, based on the definitions and distinctions made in the sources, the most accurate completion of the sentence is: An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security.

### Question 15
*Which of the following has non-conformities as an output?*

- a) Risk Assessment
- b) Risk Identification
- c) **Internal Audit**
- d) All of the Above

**Correct Answer:** c) Internal Audit

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most accurate answer is **internal audit** has nonconformities as an output.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Internal Audit and Nonconformities**:  An internal audit is a systematic process to evaluate whether an organisation's ISMS conforms to its own requirements and those of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, and whether it is effectively implemented and maintained. One of the primary outputs of an internal audit is the identification of nonconformities. A **nonconformity is the non-fulfilment of a requirement**. The internal audit process is specifically designed to detect potential nonconformities within the ISMS.  The audit report, which includes the nonconformities found, is communicated to top management.

*   **Risk Assessment and Nonconformities**: Risk assessment is a process of identifying, analysing and evaluating risks to an organisation's information assets. While risk assessment is a critical process within the ISMS, its primary outputs are related to risk identification, analysis, evaluation and treatment. **It does not directly produce nonconformities as an output**. However, risk assessments can reveal weaknesses in controls or identify areas where the ISMS might not be operating effectively, which could then be flagged as a nonconformity during an audit.

*   **Risk Identification and Nonconformities**: Risk identification is a part of the risk assessment process and focuses on finding, recognising and describing risks. Like the broader risk assessment process, risk identification does not directly produce nonconformities as its output. Instead, it generates a list of potential risks that need to be further analysed and evaluated before risk treatment options are determined.

*   **Why the other options are not the primary source of nonconformities**:
    *   **Risk assessment and risk identification** are key processes in the ISMS, but their output is about the level, type, and treatment of risks, not nonconformities in the ISMS. These processes inform the risk treatment plan and the Statement of Applicability. They can identify areas of weakness that could eventually lead to nonconformities, but this is indirect. The sources indicate that if large numbers of necessary controls have been omitted, that is indicative of a weak risk identification process.
    *   **All the above** is incorrect because risk assessment and risk identification do not directly produce nonconformities.

* **Corrective Action for Nonconformities**: Nonconformities identified by internal audits must be addressed through corrective actions. This process involves reacting to the nonconformity, determining its cause, implementing actions to eliminate recurrence, and reviewing the effectiveness of those actions. The result of any corrective actions taken must be documented.

Therefore, while risk assessment and risk identification are crucial for an ISMS, it is the **internal audit process** that has nonconformities as a direct output.

### Question 16
*Which of the following is part of risk assessment?*

- a) **Assign an owner to the risk**
- b) Treat the risk
- c) Transfer the risk
- d) Mitigate the risk

**Correct Answer:** a) Assign an owner to the risk

*Explanation:* The question asks which of the provided options is part of risk assessment. According to the sources, the risk assessment process involves several key steps.

*   **Risk assessment** is the overall process of identifying, analysing, and evaluating risks.
    *   **Risk identification** is the process of finding, recognising, and describing risks, involving the identification of risk sources, events, their causes, and their potential consequences. This can include historical data, theoretical analysis, informed and expert opinions, and stakeholders' needs.
    *   **Risk analysis** is the process of understanding the nature of risk and determining its level. This includes assessing the potential consequences and the likelihood of the risk occurring.
    *  **Risk evaluation** involves comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine if the risk is acceptable. This process assists in decisions about risk treatment.
*   **Risk treatment** is the process of modifying risk and can involve avoiding the risk, removing the source, changing the likelihood or consequences, or sharing or retaining the risk.

Looking at the provided options:

*   **a) Assign an owner to the risk**: Assigning risk owners is a key part of the **risk assessment** process. Risk owners are accountable for the management of the risks.
*   **b) Treat the risk**: Risk treatment is a separate step that follows risk assessment.
*   **c) Transfer the risk**: Transferring risk is a risk treatment option, not a step in risk assessment.
*   **d) Mitigate the risk**: Mitigating risk is a risk treatment option, which is a way of dealing with an identified risk.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **a) Assign an owner to the risk** as this is a component of the risk assessment process.

### Question 17
*Which responsibility and authority the top management is required to assign?*

- a) Auditing the ISMS at regular intervals
- b) **Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**
- c) Implementing information security controls
- d) Documenting all ISMS activities

**Correct Answer:** b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements

*Explanation:* The question asks what responsibility and authority top management is required to assign. According to the standard, top management has specific obligations regarding the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here's an analysis of the options:

*   **a) Auditing the ISMS at regular intervals**: While internal audits are a crucial part of an ISMS, the responsibility for *conducting* these audits is not what top management is specifically required to assign. Top management is responsible for ensuring that an audit programme exists, but not for the actual execution of audits.
*   **b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**: Top management *is* required to assign the responsibility and authority for ensuring that the ISMS conforms to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. This is a core requirement of the standard, as it ensures that the ISMS is properly implemented and maintained.
*   **c) Implementing information security controls**: Although the implementation of information security controls is a critical part of the ISMS, top management is not directly required to assign the *implementation* responsibility. This is typically delegated to other roles within the organisation. Top management's role is to ensure that necessary resources are provided and that the ISMS is effective.
*   **d) Documenting all ISMS activities**: Documenting ISMS activities is essential, but top management is not required to assign the responsibility for *all* documentation. Top management has the responsibility for ensuring that documented information is created and controlled, but the actual documentation activities may be delegated.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**. Top management must delegate the responsibility and authority to someone to ensure that the ISMS is compliant with the standard. This includes making sure all requirements of the standard are met.

### Question 18
*Which of the following is part of ISMS Scope?*

- a) Number of Computers
- b) Capabilities of IT Department
- c) **Locations of Information**
- d) Business Processes of the Organisation

**Correct Answer:** c) Locations of Information

*Explanation:* The question asks what is included in the scope of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). According to the standard, the scope of an ISMS defines its boundaries and applicability within an organisation. It is important to consider several factors when defining the scope of an ISMS.

Analysing the given options:

*   **a) Number of Computers**: While the number of computers might be relevant to an IT asset inventory, it does not define the scope of the ISMS itself. The scope is about what areas of the business are covered by the ISMS, not about specific assets.
*   **b) Capabilities of IT Department**: The capabilities of the IT department are more about resources and competencies, and not about the boundaries of the ISMS.
*   **c) Locations of Information**: The location of information is a relevant consideration when defining the scope of the ISMS. The scope should clarify the physical and informational boundaries of the ISMS. This can include the physical address or region where information is processed or stored and the types of assets at each location.
*   **d) Business Processes of the Organisation**: The business processes are a core element of the ISMS scope. The ISMS scope is applicable to all the departments wherever information is processed, either manually or electronically. The scope should define which departments or functions are included.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **c) Locations of Information** because it directly relates to defining the boundaries of where the ISMS applies. While business processes are also important, the question asks for "part of the ISMS scope," making locations a more direct and definitive answer. The scope must also consider the interfaces and dependencies between the organisation's activities and those of other parties.
