## Question Bank - Foundation Exam

### Question 1
*Anything that has value to the organization is known as?*

- a) CISO
- b) **Asset**
- c) Network
- d) Money

**Correct Answer:** b) Asset

*Explanation:* Anything that has value to the organization is considered an **asset**. Information is also considered an asset that drives business in today's networked environment.

Assets can include:
*   Software such as Windows and Oracle
*   Paper documents such as contracts and telephone lists
*   Supporting utilities such as VOIP, telephone, and backup power supply
*   Hardware such as servers, laptops, and PDAs
*   People such as HR managers and network engineers
*   Information such as voice messages

Utilities themselves do not carry information, but they support devices that do. Information can be static (e.g., stored on a hard disk) or being transmitted (e.g., via email). Whatever form the information takes, it must always be protected.

Access to assets should be authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements. An inventory of assets, including their owners, should be developed and maintained. The term ‘owner’ refers to the individual or entity with management responsibility for controlling the asset's security, use, development, and maintenance. The owner approves the risk level and the controls selected for protecting that asset.

---

### Question 2
*Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity:*

- a) Confidentiality
- b) Integrity
- c) Accountability
- d) **Availability**

**Correct Answer:** d) Availability

*Explanation:* The property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity is **availability**.

Availability is one of the three types of protection for information security, the others being confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Confidentiality** ensures that information is only accessed by those with a "need to know" and "need to do".
*   **Integrity** refers to the "accuracy" and "completeness" of information. It means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
*   **Availability** means that systems are accessible to authorised users when needed. This includes ensuring that computing systems that process information and the communication channels through which the information is sent are working correctly.

These three aspects are vital for business survival, as is the identification of information security requirements.

### Question 3
*Set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to establish policies and objectives and processes to achieve those objectives:*

- a) ISMS objective
- b) Policy statement
- c) **Management System**
- d) Statement of Applicability

**Correct Answer:** c) Management System (References/1)

*Explanation:* Based on the standard:

*   **a) ISMS objective:** An ISMS (Information Security Management System) objective is a desired outcome or goal related to information security that an organisation sets for itself. Objectives should be consistent with the information security policy, measurable, and take into account applicable requirements as well as results from risk assessment and risk treatment. **While ISMS objectives are a crucial component of the ISMS, they are not the entire set of interrelated or interacting elements themselves**. Objectives are what an ISMS aims to achieve.

*   **b) Policy statement**: A policy statement, specifically an information security policy, provides a framework for setting information security objectives and includes a commitment to satisfy requirements and to continually improve the ISMS. The policy is a documented information, communicated within the organization and available to interested parties. **A policy statement is an important part of a management system, but it does not encompass all the interacting elements needed to establish and achieve objectives**. It provides direction and commitment, but not the processes for implementation.

*   **c) Management System:** A management system is a framework of guidelines, policies, procedures, processes and associated resources aimed at ensuring an organisation meets its objectives. An ISMS is a type of management system that focuses specifically on information security. The ISMS includes processes and their interactions to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve information security within an organization.  **This is the most accurate answer, as a management system is indeed a framework of interacting elements designed to achieve objectives through policies and processes**.

    *   Key components of a management system include:
        *   **Policies:** Providing the direction and framework.
        *   **Objectives:** Defining what the organization aims to achieve.
        *   **Processes:** The activities and procedures to reach the objectives.
        *   **Resources:** What is needed to implement the processes.
        *  **Interactions:** The relationships between the various processes and elements.
        *   **Continual Improvement:** Regular monitoring and adjustments to ensure effectiveness.
        *   **Documentation:**  To ensure consistency and clarity.

*  **d) Statement of Applicability (SOA):** The SOA is a documented statement describing the control objectives and controls that are relevant and applicable to the organisation's ISMS. It includes the necessary controls, justifications for their inclusion, whether they are implemented, and justification for excluding any Annex A controls. The SOA is derived from the risk treatment process. **The SOA is a key document within an ISMS, but it's a result of the ISMS processes, not the complete set of interacting elements itself**. The SOA reflects the implementation of controls but not the framework that defines how these controls are chosen and managed.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is c) Management System, as this term most closely describes the set of interrelated or interacting elements designed to establish policies, objectives, and processes to achieve those objectives within an organisation.** The other options represent important components of the ISMS, but not the entire framework of interacting elements themselves.

### Question 4
*Non-fulfilment of a requirement is:*

- a) **Non-conformity**
- b) Non-repudiation
- c) Requirement
- d) Risk

**Correct Answer:** a) Non-conformity

*Explanation:* Non-fulfilment of a requirement is a **non-conformity**.

The standard describes nonconformity and its management within the context of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) as below:
*   When a nonconformity occurs, the organization must react to it, taking action to control and correct it and deal with the consequences.
*   The organization must evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of the nonconformity, reviewing the nonconformity, determining its causes, and determining if similar nonconformities exist or could potentially occur.
*   The organisation must implement any necessary actions, review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken, and make changes to the ISMS if necessary.
*   Corrective actions should be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.
*   Documented information should be available as evidence of the nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken, and the results of any corrective action.
*   Auditors should confirm that the organisation responds by finding nonconformity and requiring corrective action when ISO/IEC 27001 and ISMS requirements are not satisfied.
*   Nonconformity and corrective action includes taking action to correct the situation, examine the cause, and determine if other occurrences exist or potentially exist elsewhere, so that action can be taken to prevent recurrence.
*   The organisation’s response should cover evaluation of the action taken to confirm that the intended result was achieved, and evaluation of the ISMS to determine if changes are warranted to avoid future occurrences of similar nonconformities.
*   Documentation of the nonconformity, corrective action, and the results should be created and controlled in accordance with the requirements of documented information.
*   Nonconformities should be managed with corrections and corrective actions.

Other terms in the question mentioned:
*   **Non-repudiation** In law, non-repudiation is a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated"
*  A **requirement** is a need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory. It may be a business, legal, security or other kind of requirement. 
*   A **risk** is the effect of uncertainty on objectives and can be positive or negative. Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the likelihood of an event and its consequences.

### Question 5
*Overall process of risk identification, risk analysis  and risk evaluation:*

- a) Risk Management
- b) Risk Analysis
- c) **Risk Assessment**
- d) Risk Treatment

**Correct Answer:** c) Risk Assessment

*Explanation:* The overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation is known as **risk assessment**.

Here's a breakdown of the terms in the question, according to standard:

*   **Risk assessment** is the overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation.
    *   **Risk identification** is the process of finding, recognising and describing risks. It involves identifying risk sources, events, their causes and potential consequences. Risk identification can involve historical data, theoretical analysis, expert opinions, and stakeholder needs.
    *   **Risk analysis** is the process of understanding the nature of risk and determining its level. Risk analysis provides an input to risk evaluation and decisions on how risks should be treated. Risk analysis can be qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative.
    *   **Risk evaluation** is the process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude is acceptable or tolerable. It assists in making decisions about risk treatment.
*   **Risk management** consists of coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk. It encompasses risk assessment, risk treatment, risk monitoring, and risk review.
*  **Risk treatment** is the process of modifying risk. Risk treatment can involve avoiding the risk, taking or increasing risk to pursue an opportunity, removing the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk, or retaining the risk. Risk treatments that deal with negative consequences are sometimes referred to as “risk mitigation”, “risk elimination”, “risk prevention” and “risk reduction”. Risk treatment can also create new risks or modify existing risks.

Therefore, while risk analysis is a component of risk assessment, and risk management encompasses all of the processes, risk assessment is the correct answer to this question.

The standard also note the following points about risk assessment and its related processes:
*   Risk assessment should be a comparable and repeatable process.
*   Risk assessment should be performed at planned intervals or when significant changes occur.
*   The results of risk assessments should be consistent, valid and comparable.
*   Risk assessment should include the identification of risk owners.
*   Risk assessments must be documented.
*   The risk assessment process should be applied to identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the information security management system.
*  The risk assessment process should be used to identify risks that can create, enhance, prevent, degrade, accelerate, or delay the achievement of the organization's objectives, and should consider risks whether or not their source is under the control of the organization.
*   Risk assessments should be based on informed decisions.

In addition, the standard identifies a variety of standards and guides related to risk assessment including ISO 31000, IEC 31010, and ISO/IEC 27005.

### Question 6
*Person or group of people who directs and controls an organization at the highest level?*

- a) Steering Committee
- b) Board
- c) **Top Management**
- d) Management Representative

**Correct Answer:** c) Top Management

*Explanation:* The person or group of people who directs and controls an organisation at the highest level is **top management**. Top management has a crucial role in the implementation and maintenance of an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here’s a breakdown of the responsibilities and aspects of top management, as described in the sources:
*   **Leadership and Commitment**: Top management must demonstrate leadership and commitment to the ISMS by ensuring that information security policies and objectives are compatible with the organisation’s strategic direction. They should ensure that the ISMS requirements are integrated into the organisation’s processes, and that the necessary resources are available. They must also communicate the importance of effective information security and of conforming to ISMS requirements.
*   **Accountability and Authority**: Top management is responsible for assigning and communicating the responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant to information security. This includes ensuring that the ISMS conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 and reporting on the performance of the ISMS. Top management also remains accountable for the satisfactory completion of activities assigned to the organisation.
*   **Integration of ISMS**: Top management must ensure the integration of the ISMS requirements into the organisation's processes. This means that information security should be considered in all areas of the business, not as a separate function.
*   **Resource Provision**: Top management has to ensure the availability of resources for an effective ISMS, assessing resource needs during management reviews, and setting objectives for continual improvement.
*   **Management Reviews**: Top management must review the ISMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. These reviews must include a consideration of actions from previous reviews, changes in the internal and external context, feedback on ISMS performance, results of risk assessments, and opportunities for improvement.
*   **Culture and Environment**: Top management is responsible for creating a culture and environment that encourages people to work actively towards the goals of ISO/IEC 27001.

While the term ‘Management Representative’ is used in the sources, it is noted that this is not a requirement of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard, and that the responsibility for managing the ISMS can be assigned to an individual, shared by several individuals or assigned to a team. The sources also indicate that the individual or team managing the ISMS should have sufficient access to top management to keep them informed of the status and performance of the ISMS.

Therefore, the correct answer is **c. Top Management**.

### Question 7
*Processes and procedures for ensuring continued information security operations?*

- a) **Information Security Continuity**
- b) Business Continuity Plan
- c) Disaster Recovery Plan
- d) Business Impact Analysis

**Correct Answer:** a) Information Security Continuity (References/2)

*Explanation:* The question asks about processes and procedures for ensuring continued information security operations. Considering the options provided:

*   **a) Information Security Continuity** is a critical component that involves having processes, procedures and controls in place to ensure that information security is maintained during adverse situations. It requires a management structure that can prepare for and respond to disruptive events, nominating personnel to maintain security, and having plans for response and recovery. These plans must include how to maintain information security while managing a disruptive event. Also, it’s essential to verify that these implemented controls are valid and effective, testing their functionality, and ensuring they are reviewed and updated as necessary.
*   **b) Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** is a proactive plan designed to deliver service obligations during business disruptions. BCPs ensure business continuity and involve all business functions. This includes assessing BCP/DR scenarios to make sure that security controls are in place during disasters. The plan should be developed, implemented, and reviewed to restore the security of critical business processes following interruption or failure.
*   **c) Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** refers to the procedures designed to ensure that technology can recover from disruptions, as per business expectations.
*   **d) Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** relates specific risks and threats to their impact on key business issues. It is a starting point for business continuity planning and its results should guide the planning. The BIA process assesses impacts over time, identifies prioritized activities and assigns a recovery time objective (RTO). It also determines the necessary resources to support activities, such as ICT services, and defines the performance and capacity requirements of ICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO).

While all four options are related to ensuring operational resilience, they have different roles. Options b, c, and d contribute to the broader goal of maintaining business operations during disruptions but not necessarily information security operations alone. Option a, **Information Security Continuity**, directly addresses maintaining security during adverse conditions, therefore, it is the most correct answer on its own.

**Therefore, the most correct answer is a) Information Security Continuity.**

### Question 8
*Which of the following is an evidence of commitment and leadership in regard to the ISMS?*

- a) **Promoting continual improvement**
- b) Testing employees' knowledge and skills
- c) Implementing corrective action
- d) Auditing the ISMS

**Correct Answer:** a) Promoting continual improvement

*Explanation:* Of the options you've provided, **promoting continual improvement** is the most direct evidence of commitment and leadership in regard to the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here's why, based on the standard:

*   **Leadership and Commitment:** Top management is required to demonstrate leadership and commitment with respect to the ISMS. This includes promoting continual improvement.
*   **Continual Improvement:** The standard explicitly states that top management should promote continual improvement as part of their leadership responsibilities. This demonstrates an active engagement in enhancing the ISMS over time.
*   **Management Review:** Top management is responsible for reviewing the ISMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness, and this includes identifying opportunities for continual improvement.
*   **Actions for Improvement**: The organisation is required to continually improve the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the ISMS, taking actions based on audits, analysis of monitored events, and corrective actions.

While the other options are also important for an effective ISMS, they don't directly demonstrate leadership commitment in the same way:

*   **Testing employees' knowledge and skills** is a part of ensuring competence and awareness, but it is more about maintaining a baseline level of security rather than showing commitment from leadership.
*   **Implementing corrective action** is a necessary response to nonconformities, but it is more about addressing problems than showing proactive commitment to improvement.
*   **Auditing the ISMS** is a key part of the performance evaluation and provides information on whether the ISMS conforms to requirements and is effectively implemented. Although this is an important activity, it is not a direct demonstration of leadership commitment in the same way as actively promoting and implementing improvements.

Therefore, while all of these are important activities within an ISMS, **promoting continual improvement** is the one that specifically demonstrates leadership and commitment.

### Question 9
*What does the management review include?*

- a) **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives**
- b) Detection of non-conformities
- c) Implementing corrective actions
- d) Discipline of non-complying employees

**Correct Answer:** a) Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most appropriate single answer to your question about what a management review includes is: **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives**.

Here's why:

*   **Fulfilment of Information Security Objectives:** The sources explicitly state that a management review includes "feedback on the information security performance, including trends in... fulfilment of information security objectives". This is a core component, ensuring that the ISMS is meeting its intended goals.
*   **Other Included Items**: While other options you provided are related to the ISMS, they are either components of, or are supported by, the information security objective. For example, detection of nonconformities and implementing corrective actions are parts of the feedback loop that informs the management of the ISMS, but the review is ultimately focused on whether the objectives are being met.

Here is more detail about what a management review includes:

*   **Status of Actions from Previous Reviews:** Reviews the progress of actions from prior meetings.
*   **Changes in Context:** Considers changes in external and internal issues relevant to the ISMS.
*  **Needs of Interested Parties**: Takes into account the needs and expectations of interested parties.
*   **Feedback on Information Security Performance:** Includes trends in nonconformities and corrective actions, monitoring and measurement results, audit results, and the fulfilment of information security objectives.
*   **Risk Assessment and Treatment:** Reviews the results of risk assessments and the status of the risk treatment plan.
*   **Opportunities for Continual Improvement:** Identifies opportunities for improvement of the ISMS.

Therefore, while detection of non-conformities and implementing corrective actions are part of the ISMS processes and are considered during a management review, the **fulfilment of information security objectives** is the most direct and central element of the management review according to the sources. The discipline of non-complying employees is not specifically mentioned as a direct component of a management review.

### Question 10
*An information security risk is?*

- a) The potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation
- b) The impact of a threat on Information Security
- c) **The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability**
- d) A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats

**Correct Answer:** c) The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, an information security risk is best defined as **the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability**.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Risk Defined:** A risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. It is the potential for something to go wrong, and it includes the possibility of both positive and negative outcomes. In the context of information security, it is the potential for loss or damage.
*   **Risk Components:** Information security risk arises from the interaction of several components:
    *   **Threat:**  A threat is anything that can harm an information asset, and can be man-made or a natural event.
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited to harm an information asset.
    *   **Impact**: The potential consequences that would result if a risk were to materialize.
*   **How Risk Occurs:** A risk materializes when a threat exploits a vulnerability, leading to a potential negative impact, such as loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Risk assessment involves several steps, which include identifying the risks, analysing potential consequences and the likelihood of those consequences and then evaluating the results against risk criteria.
*   **Risk Treatment**: After risks have been assessed, actions are taken to modify the risk by selecting appropriate options and implementing necessary controls.

Let's consider the options you provided, based on the sources:

*   **"The potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation"** This describes a **threat**, not a risk itself. A threat is a potential source of harm, but it does not represent the overall risk.
*   **"The impact of a threat on information security"** While impact is a component of risk, it is not the full definition of a risk. A risk includes both the likelihood of an event and its impact.
*   **"A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats"** This is the definition of a **vulnerability**.  A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit, but the risk is what happens if the vulnerability is exploited.

Therefore, the most accurate definition of an information security risk is:  **the potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.** This captures the combined effect of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and leading to a potential negative consequence, which is at the core of understanding information security risk.

### Question 11
*Top management must assign and communicate?*

- a) **Responsibilities and Roles for Information Security**
- b) Corrective Action to Security Team Members
- c) ISMS review tasks to the System Administrator
- d) Non-Conformities found during Audit

**Correct Answer:** a) Responsibilities and Roles for Information Security

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, top management must assign and communicate **responsibilities and roles for information security**.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the most accurate answer, with references to the sources:

*   **Responsibilities and Authorities:** Top management is explicitly required to ensure that the responsibilities and authorities for roles relevant to information security are assigned and communicated. This includes assigning the responsibility and authority for ensuring the ISMS conforms to the requirements of the standard and for reporting on the performance of the ISMS to top management.

*   **Communication of Roles:** The sources emphasize that these responsibilities and authorities must not only be assigned but also communicated. This ensures that all individuals involved in the ISMS understand their roles and obligations. Top management should ensure the responsibilities and authorities are communicated in accordance with the requirements of the communication clause (7.4).

*  **Not just one person**: The role of ensuring the management system conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 can be assigned to an individual, shared by several individuals or assigned to a team.

Let's examine the other options you provided and why they are not the primary responsibility that top management must assign and communicate, according to the sources:

*   **Corrective action to security team members**: While corrective actions are a part of the ISMS, the assignment of these actions to specific team members is a downstream activity that may follow an audit or non-conformity detection. The top management's primary responsibility is to establish the overall ISMS and to assign roles and responsibilities, not to assign specific corrective actions to individual team members. The sources do state that when a nonconformity occurs, the organisation shall react to it, take actions to control and correct it, and deal with the consequences. The organisation should evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of nonconformity. This is a process that would be followed based on the identification of non-conformities, and not something that would be assigned on a regular basis by the top management.

*   **ISMS review tasks to the system administrator**: While system administrators may be involved in ISMS activities, assigning specific review tasks is more of a delegation of duties. Top management's key action is to ensure that there is a person, or team, responsible for the ISMS itself. Top management has to also ensure that the ISMS achieves its intended outcome, by supporting the implementation of all information security management processes and in particular, through requesting and reviewing reports on the status and effectiveness of the ISMS. The management review itself is driven by top management, not by a system administrator.

*   **Non-conformities found during audit**: Top management must ensure that the responsibilities for implementation of the ISMS are assigned to roles, and that top management is accountable for these responsibilities. Top management also needs to make sure that the performance reporting is conducted in accordance with the requirements of the management review. However, while the management review will take into account non-conformities found during audits, top management do not need to directly assign and communicate these.

In summary, while all of the other options are related to the operation of an ISMS, the most direct and fundamental requirement for top management is to **assign and communicate responsibilities and roles for information security.** This sets the foundation for the rest of the ISMS processes.

### Question 12
*Which of the following is part of the Risk Treatment Plan?*

- a) Which controls to implement
- b) What are the resources to implement the security controls
- c) What are the deadlines of the security controls implementation
- d) **All of the Above**

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the Above

*Explanation:* Based on the provided sources, the most accurate answer is **all of the above** are part of a risk treatment plan.

Here's why, with a detailed breakdown:

*   **Risk Treatment Plan Components:** A risk treatment plan is a crucial document that outlines how an organisation will modify identified risks. It includes:
    *   **The risk being addressed**:  The specific risk that the plan is designed to mitigate, and its level according to the assessment.
    *  **Actions to treat the risk**: The actions proposed to modify the risk, which includes selecting appropriate controls to implement.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Clearly defines who is in charge of implementing the proposed actions.
    *   **Resources**: Outlines the necessary resources (e.g., budget, personnel, tools) required to implement the controls.
    *   **Timeframe:** Specifies the deadlines for the implementation of the risk treatment actions and controls.
    *  **Implementation Status:** Indicates whether the necessary controls are implemented or not.
    *  **Expected Benefits**: Explains the reasons for selection of treatment options, including the benefits to be gained.
   *  **Performance Measures:** Includes performance measures and constraints.
    * **Reporting and Monitoring:** Includes a method of reporting and monitoring the implementation of the plan.
*   **Controls Selection:** The risk treatment plan includes the selection of appropriate information security risk treatment options, taking into account risk assessment results. This involves determining **which controls to implement**. The risk treatment plan should be formulated from the outputs of the risk assessment. The chosen controls should be compared with those in Annex A of the standard, in order to verify that no necessary controls have been omitted.
*  **Resource Allocation**: A risk treatment plan includes the resources needed for the plan's implementation, such as finances, personnel, and technology. This includes determining **what are the resources to implement the security controls**.
*   **Deadlines for Implementation:** The plan includes defined timeframes and schedules for implementing the selected controls and actions. This answers **what are the deadlines of the security controls implementation**. The risk treatment plan should also link to or include the implementation status of necessary controls.
*  **Approval of Risk Owners**: The risk treatment plan needs to be approved by the risk owners, who are also responsible for accepting the residual risk after the plan is implemented.

Therefore, all of the options you listed — **which controls to implement, what are the resources to implement the security controls, and what are the deadlines of the security controls implementation** — are indeed essential components of a comprehensive risk treatment plan as defined in the sources.

### Question 13
*Which of the following is a statement of a top level information security policy?*

- a) **Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it**
- b) Install anti malware on all organisation computers
- c) Encrypt sensitive data transiting in the company network
- d) Do not allow teleworking

**Correct Answer:** a) Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it

*Explanation:* Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the statement that best represents a top-level information security policy is: **ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it**.

Here's a breakdown of why this is the most accurate answer, with references to the sources:

*   **Top-Level Policy Characteristics:** A top-level information security policy should be broad, setting the overall direction and principles for information security within the organisation. It should outline the organisation's commitment to information security and provide a framework for setting more specific security objectives. It is not meant to be overly detailed or technical. The sources also note that the policy should be appropriate to the purpose of the organisation and not too generic. It should also include a commitment to satisfying applicable legal and regulatory requirements and a commitment to continual improvement.

*   **"Ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it"**: This statement aligns with the core principle of **confidentiality**, which is a key element of information security. It is a high-level statement of intent that sets the direction for access controls and related security measures, without getting into the specifics. It defines a broad objective that can be further broken down into more detailed policies and controls. A top-level policy like this would normally be supported by more specific topic-based policies, such as a policy on access control.

Let's examine the other options you provided and why they are more likely to be specific controls or topic-specific policies, rather than top-level information security policies:

*   **"Install anti-malware on all organisation computers"**: This is a specific **technical control** that would be part of a more detailed policy or procedure, likely under the area of malware protection. It's an action that supports the overall goal of information security, but it's too specific to be a top-level policy statement. Top-level policies are more about "what" and "why", while specific controls are about "how". The sources indicate that a high-level policy should be supported by topic-specific policies that mandate the implementation of information security controls.

*  **"Encrypt sensitive data transiting in the company network"**: This statement, while important, refers to a specific **technical security measure** related to network security and cryptography. It is a control that would be part of a more detailed policy on data protection or network security. A top-level policy would not specify a particular method of protecting the data; instead, it would specify the overall need to protect it. The use of cryptography is a control that an organisation can adopt, but not necessarily one that they must adopt, so it would not be something that should be included in a top level policy statement.

*   **"Do not allow teleworking"**: This is a specific **rule** that an organisation might implement as part of their security measures, likely covered by a mobile device and teleworking policy. This type of statement is too narrow and restrictive to be a top-level policy. It limits the operational practices of the organisation, and doesn't define a security goal or objective. The sources suggest that a topic-specific policy on teleworking should exist if it is allowed, and if not, then that would be part of overall security requirements.

In summary, a top-level information security policy is meant to be a guiding principle that sets the tone for all information security activities within the organisation, as well as being appropriate for the purpose of the organisation. While the other options are relevant to information security, they are specific controls, rules or practices, rather than high-level strategic statements. Therefore, the statement **"ensure that information is accessible only to those authorised to have access to it"** best represents a top-level information security policy.

### Question 14
*Complete the Sentence: An information security incident is a security ____ that have a significant probability of compromising information security.*

- a) Breach
- b) Vulnerability
- c) Threat
- d) **Event**

**Correct Answer:** d) Event

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most accurate completion of the sentence is: An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security.

Here's why, with a detailed explanation drawing from the sources:

*   **Information Security Event vs. Incident:** The sources make a clear distinction between security events and security incidents. A security event is any **observable occurrence** in a system or network, which could potentially indicate a breach or a problem. This can include a wide range of occurrences, such as:
    *   Ineffective information security controls
    *   Human errors
    *   A virus detected on a system
    *   Breaches of physical security
    *   Passwords being exposed
    *   Hardware or software malfunctions
    *   Uncontrolled system changes
    *   Unauthorised access
    *   Non-compliance with policies or legal requirements

    An information security incident, on the other hand, is a security event that is determined to **have a significant probability of compromising information security**. In other words, not all security events are classified as incidents; only those that meet specific criteria. An organisation must assess the events and decide if they are to be categorised as incidents.

*   **Why "event" is the correct choice:** The completed sentence is "An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security." This wording reflects the hierarchical relationship described in the sources, where an incident is a type of security event, not a breach, vulnerability, or threat. The assessment of security events is an essential step in determining if an incident has occurred.

*   **Why other options are not the best fit**:
    *   **Breach:** A breach is a specific type of incident where security has been violated. A security event that has a high probability of causing a breach would be considered an incident. So "breach" is not the best fit.
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat. While a vulnerability can lead to an incident, it is not the incident itself. So, "vulnerability" is not the best fit.
    *   **Threat:** A threat is something that can cause harm to an asset, such as a virus or a hacker. It is the cause, not the event. So, "threat" is not the best fit.

Therefore, based on the definitions and distinctions made in the sources, the most accurate completion of the sentence is: An information security incident is a security **event** that has a significant probability of compromising information security.

### Question 15
*Which of the following has non-conformities as an output?*

- a) Risk Assessment
- b) Risk Identification
- c) **Internal Audit**
- d) All of the Above

**Correct Answer:** c) Internal Audit

*Explanation:* Based on the standard, the most accurate answer is **internal audit** has nonconformities as an output.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Internal Audit and Nonconformities**:  An internal audit is a systematic process to evaluate whether an organisation's ISMS conforms to its own requirements and those of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, and whether it is effectively implemented and maintained. One of the primary outputs of an internal audit is the identification of nonconformities. A **nonconformity is the non-fulfilment of a requirement**. The internal audit process is specifically designed to detect potential nonconformities within the ISMS.  The audit report, which includes the nonconformities found, is communicated to top management.

*   **Risk Assessment and Nonconformities**: Risk assessment is a process of identifying, analysing and evaluating risks to an organisation's information assets. While risk assessment is a critical process within the ISMS, its primary outputs are related to risk identification, analysis, evaluation and treatment. **It does not directly produce nonconformities as an output**. However, risk assessments can reveal weaknesses in controls or identify areas where the ISMS might not be operating effectively, which could then be flagged as a nonconformity during an audit.

*   **Risk Identification and Nonconformities**: Risk identification is a part of the risk assessment process and focuses on finding, recognising and describing risks. Like the broader risk assessment process, risk identification does not directly produce nonconformities as its output. Instead, it generates a list of potential risks that need to be further analysed and evaluated before risk treatment options are determined.

*   **Why the other options are not the primary source of nonconformities**:
    *   **Risk assessment and risk identification** are key processes in the ISMS, but their output is about the level, type, and treatment of risks, not nonconformities in the ISMS. These processes inform the risk treatment plan and the Statement of Applicability. They can identify areas of weakness that could eventually lead to nonconformities, but this is indirect. The sources indicate that if large numbers of necessary controls have been omitted, that is indicative of a weak risk identification process.
    *   **All the above** is incorrect because risk assessment and risk identification do not directly produce nonconformities.

* **Corrective Action for Nonconformities**: Nonconformities identified by internal audits must be addressed through corrective actions. This process involves reacting to the nonconformity, determining its cause, implementing actions to eliminate recurrence, and reviewing the effectiveness of those actions. The result of any corrective actions taken must be documented.

Therefore, while risk assessment and risk identification are crucial for an ISMS, it is the **internal audit process** that has nonconformities as a direct output.

### Question 16
*Which of the following is part of risk assessment?*

- a) **Assign an owner to the risk**
- b) Treat the risk
- c) Transfer the risk
- d) Mitigate the risk

**Correct Answer:** a) Assign an owner to the risk

*Explanation:* The question asks which of the provided options is part of risk assessment. According to the sources, the risk assessment process involves several key steps.

*   **Risk assessment** is the overall process of identifying, analysing, and evaluating risks.
    *   **Risk identification** is the process of finding, recognising, and describing risks, involving the identification of risk sources, events, their causes, and their potential consequences. This can include historical data, theoretical analysis, informed and expert opinions, and stakeholders' needs.
    *   **Risk analysis** is the process of understanding the nature of risk and determining its level. This includes assessing the potential consequences and the likelihood of the risk occurring.
    *  **Risk evaluation** involves comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine if the risk is acceptable. This process assists in decisions about risk treatment.
*   **Risk treatment** is the process of modifying risk and can involve avoiding the risk, removing the source, changing the likelihood or consequences, or sharing or retaining the risk.

Looking at the provided options:

*   **a) Assign an owner to the risk**: Assigning risk owners is a key part of the **risk assessment** process. Risk owners are accountable for the management of the risks.
*   **b) Treat the risk**: Risk treatment is a separate step that follows risk assessment.
*   **c) Transfer the risk**: Transferring risk is a risk treatment option, not a step in risk assessment.
*   **d) Mitigate the risk**: Mitigating risk is a risk treatment option, which is a way of dealing with an identified risk.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **a) Assign an owner to the risk** as this is a component of the risk assessment process.

### Question 17
*Which responsibility and authority the top management is required to assign?*

- a) Auditing the ISMS at regular intervals
- b) **Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**
- c) Implementing information security controls
- d) Documenting all ISMS activities

**Correct Answer:** b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements

*Explanation:* The question asks what responsibility and authority top management is required to assign. According to the standard, top management has specific obligations regarding the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here's an analysis of the options:

*   **a) Auditing the ISMS at regular intervals**: While internal audits are a crucial part of an ISMS, the responsibility for *conducting* these audits is not what top management is specifically required to assign. Top management is responsible for ensuring that an audit programme exists, but not for the actual execution of audits.
*   **b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**: Top management *is* required to assign the responsibility and authority for ensuring that the ISMS conforms to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. This is a core requirement of the standard, as it ensures that the ISMS is properly implemented and maintained.
*   **c) Implementing information security controls**: Although the implementation of information security controls is a critical part of the ISMS, top management is not directly required to assign the *implementation* responsibility. This is typically delegated to other roles within the organisation. Top management's role is to ensure that necessary resources are provided and that the ISMS is effective.
*   **d) Documenting all ISMS activities**: Documenting ISMS activities is essential, but top management is not required to assign the responsibility for *all* documentation. Top management has the responsibility for ensuring that documented information is created and controlled, but the actual documentation activities may be delegated.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **b) Ensuring the ISMS conforms to ISO 27001 requirements**. Top management must delegate the responsibility and authority to someone to ensure that the ISMS is compliant with the standard. This includes making sure all requirements of the standard are met.

### Question 18
*Which of the following is part of ISMS Scope?*

- a) Number of Computers
- b) Capabilities of IT Department
- c) **Locations of Information**
- d) Business Processes of the Organisation

**Correct Answer:** c) Locations of Information

*Explanation:* The question asks what is included in the scope of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). According to the standard, the scope of an ISMS defines its boundaries and applicability within an organisation. It is important to consider several factors when defining the scope of an ISMS.

Analysing the given options:

*   **a) Number of Computers**: While the number of computers might be relevant to an IT asset inventory, it does not define the scope of the ISMS itself. The scope is about what areas of the business are covered by the ISMS, not about specific assets.
*   **b) Capabilities of IT Department**: The capabilities of the IT department are more about resources and competencies, and not about the boundaries of the ISMS.
*   **c) Locations of Information**: The location of information is a relevant consideration when defining the scope of the ISMS. The scope should clarify the physical and informational boundaries of the ISMS. This can include the physical address or region where information is processed or stored and the types of assets at each location.
*   **d) Business Processes of the Organisation**: The business processes are a core element of the ISMS scope. The ISMS scope is applicable to all the departments wherever information is processed, either manually or electronically. The scope should define which departments or functions are included.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **c) Locations of Information** because it directly relates to defining the boundaries of where the ISMS applies. While business processes are also important, the question asks for "part of the ISMS scope," making locations a more direct and definitive answer. The scope must also consider the interfaces and dependencies between the organisation's activities and those of other parties.

### Question 19
*Information Security objectives should be?*

- a) Identifiable
- b) Time Bound
- c) Simple
- d) **Measurable**

**Correct Answer:** d) Measurable

*Explanation:* The question asks what characteristic information security objectives should have. According to the standard, information security objectives are a crucial part of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and must adhere to specific criteria.

Analysing the provided options:

*   **a) Identifiable**: While it is important to be able to identify what the information security objectives are, this is not one of the core characteristics of the objectives themselves. Objectives should be clear but that's part of what makes them measurable, not an objective in itself.
*   **b) Time Bound**: Although time frames are important when planning how to achieve objectives, being time bound is not a characteristic of the objectives themselves. Instead, it is part of the plan for achieving those objectives. When planning to achieve information security objectives, the organisation should determine what will be done, what resources will be required, who will be responsible and when it will be completed.
*   **c) Simple**: While it is beneficial for objectives to be clear and easy to understand, simplicity is not a core requirement of information security objectives. Instead, policies should be simple and easy to understand.
*  **d) Measurable**: Information security objectives should be measurable, if practicable. This means there should be a way to determine if the objective has been achieved. If it is not feasible to measure an objective, this needs to be noted. The objectives should also be monitored, updated as appropriate, and available as documented information.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **d) Measurable**. Information security objectives must be measurable so that progress towards them can be tracked, and their fulfilment can be verified.

### Question 20
*Which of the following is not required to be documented according to ISO 27001?*

- a) Scope of the ISMS
- b) Information Security Policies and Objectives
- c) **Resources required by the ISMS**
- d) Statement of Applicability

**Correct Answer:** c) Resources required by the ISMS

*Explanation:* The question asks which of the listed items is not required to be documented according to ISO 27001. The standard specifies several requirements for documented information within an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Here's an analysis of each option:

*   **a) Scope of the ISMS**: The scope of the ISMS *is* required to be documented. The organisation must determine the boundaries and applicability of the ISMS, and this scope must be available as documented information. The scope can be limited to parts of the organisation or cover the whole organisation and should consider internal and external issues, the needs of interested parties and interfaces between the organisation's activities and the activities of others.
*   **b) Information Security Policies and Objectives**: The information security policy *is* required to be documented. It must include a framework for setting information security objectives. The policy should also be available as documented information, communicated within the organisation, and available to interested parties. Information security objectives themselves also have to be documented.
*   **c) Resources required by the ISMS**: While the standard requires that the organisation determines and provides the resources needed for the ISMS, it does *not* explicitly require that the specific resources themselves be documented, though records of the resources that the organisation needs can be collected through documented information. Top management must ensure that the resources needed for the ISMS are available. There is also a requirement to evaluate resource needs.
*   **d) Statement of Applicability**: A Statement of Applicability (SoA) *is* a mandatory document in ISO 27001. The SoA includes the necessary controls, justification for their inclusion, whether the controls are implemented or not and the justification for excluding any controls from Annex A.

Therefore, the correct answer is **c) Resources required by the ISMS**. Although the provision of resources is a requirement, the standard does not specifically mandate that the resources themselves be documented. The other options are all explicitly required to be documented according to ISO 27001.

### Question 21
*Which of the following is required by ISO/IEC 27001 in regard to employees?*

- a) All employees should be ISO 27001 Foundation Certified
- b) **Keeping records as evidence of competence of all employees**
- c) Only IT Employees should be ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certified
- d) Employees should attend a training on ISO/IEC 27001

**Correct Answer:** b) Keeping records as evidence of competence of all employees

*Explanation:* The question asks what ISO/IEC 27001 requires in regard to employees. According to the standard, ISO/IEC 27001 places several requirements on organisations regarding their personnel, focusing on competence, awareness, and responsibilities.

Here's an analysis of each option:

*   **a) All employees should be ISO 27001 Foundation Certified**: ISO/IEC 27001 does **not** require all employees to be ISO 27001 Foundation certified. While the standard emphasises the importance of competence and training, it does not mandate that all employees must hold a specific certification. The ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certification is designed to demonstrate an individual's understanding of the principles of information security and the requirements for an ISMS. It is intended for managers, consultants and professionals involved in information security.
*   **b) Keeping records as evidence of competence of all employees**: ISO/IEC 27001 *does* require that organisations retain documented information as evidence of the competence of personnel whose work affects information security. The organisation needs to determine the necessary competence of these personnel, ensure they are competent, take action to acquire competence and evaluate the effectiveness of those actions.
*   **c) Only IT Employees should be ISO/IEC 27001 Foundation certified**: The standard does not specify that only IT employees should be certified. The standard is applicable to any department and any industry. The focus is on ensuring that all personnel, in any department, whose work affects information security are competent.
*   **d) Employees should attend a training on ISO/IEC 27001**: While ISO/IEC 27001 does not explicitly mandate that employees attend training *on* ISO/IEC 27001, it does require that personnel receive appropriate information security awareness, education, and training. This training should include regular updates on the organisation's information security policy and procedures. The training should be relevant to their job functions.

Therefore, the most correct answer is **b) Keeping records as evidence of competence of all employees**. ISO/IEC 27001 mandates the organisation to maintain documented evidence of employee competence, ensuring that those who impact information security are adequately skilled and knowledgeable.

---

### Question 22
*Which of the following is an output of the ISMS internal audit?*

- a) **Observations**
- b) Reviewed Risks
- c) Threat
- d) Vulnerabilities

**Correct Answer:** a) Observations

*Explanation:* The correct option is **a) Observations**.

Here's why:

*   **Internal audits** are conducted to assess whether an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS) conforms to requirements and is effectively implemented.
*   During audits, information is gathered through various methods, including **observations**, interviews and review of documents. This information is verified and recorded as audit evidence.
*   The results of an internal audit are reported to the relevant management and can include nonconformities and corrective actions.
*   While audits may consider risks and vulnerabilities in an ISMS, these are not outputs of the audit itself, but rather components of the ISMS that are being examined.
*   The output of an internal audit is an audit report which contains findings based on gathered evidence which can include observations.

Therefore, while risk and vulnerability information might be considered during the audit process, **observations** are a key output of the ISMS internal audit.

---

### Question 23
*Complete the sentence: Helping employees understand their role and the impact they have on the ISMS is a form of ? which is part of the support that top management should demonstrate to the ISMS*

- a) Communication
- b) Competencies
- c) **Awareness**
- d) Resources

**Correct Answer:** c) Awareness

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **c) Awareness**.

Here's why:

*   **Top management** is responsible for demonstrating leadership and commitment to the ISMS. This includes ensuring that employees understand their roles and impact on the ISMS.

*   **Awareness** programs are designed to ensure that individuals understand the information security policy, their contribution to the ISMS, and the implications of not conforming to ISMS requirements. **Helping employees understand their role and the impact they have on the ISMS is a key part of awareness training**.

*   While **communication** is also a crucial part of ISMS, it is a broader term that encompasses the mechanisms for conveying information, while **awareness** is specifically focused on making sure individuals understand their security responsibilities. 

*   **Competencies** refer to the necessary skills and knowledge of individuals performing work under the organization’s control that can affect information security. While competence is important for the ISMS, it is separate from the general understanding of roles and responsibilities that awareness seeks to achieve.

*   **Resources** refer to the people, infrastructure, technology, information and finances needed to establish, implement, maintain and improve the ISMS. Resources enable the ISMS to function effectively but are distinct from training and education.

Therefore, helping employees understand their role and the impact they have on the ISMS is most accurately described as a form of **awareness**, which is a key part of the support that top management should demonstrate to the ISMS.

---

### Question 24
*What action about a non-conformity is required?*

- a) Report who is responsible for the non-conformity
- b) Make sure the non-conformity doesn't happen again
- c) **Corrective Action**
- d) Record impact of the non-conformity

**Correct Answer:** c) Corrective Action

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **c) Corrective Action**.

When a nonconformity occurs, the organisation must react and take action to control and correct it, and deal with the consequences. The organisation must then evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of the nonconformity, in order that it does not recur or occur elsewhere.

This involves:
*   Reviewing the nonconformity.
*   Determining the causes of the nonconformity.
*   Determining if similar nonconformities exist, or could potentially occur.
*   Implementing any action needed.
*   Reviewing the effectiveness of any corrective action taken.
*   Making changes to the information security management system if necessary.

Corrective actions should be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered. Documented information must be available as evidence of the nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken, as well as the results of any corrective action.

The organisation should also confirm that the nonconformity and corrective action includes taking action to correct the situation, examine the cause and determine if other occurrences exist or potentially exist elsewhere so that action can be taken to prevent recurrence. The organisation's response should cover evaluation of the action taken to confirm that the intended result was achieved, and evaluation of the ISMS to determine if changes are warranted to avoid future occurrences of similar nonconformities.

### Question 25
*Which of the following should appear in the risk treatment plan?*

- a) When is the audit of the risk treatment plan scheduled
- b) **Who is responsible to implement the controls**
- c) Who should review the risk treatment plan
- d) The residual risk after the treatment

**Correct Answer:** b) Who is responsible to implement the controls

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **b) Who is responsible to implement the controls**.

A risk treatment plan should include:
*   **The risk that is being addressed** and its level according to the assessment.
*   **The actions proposed to treat the risk**.
*   **Who is in charge of implementing the actions**.
*   Resources (budget).
*   Timeframe for implementation.

Additionally, the risk treatment plan should include or link to:
* The risk(s) that the plan addresses
* Necessary control(s)
* How the necessary controls are expected to modify the risk so that the risk acceptance criteria are met
* The risk owners
* Selected risk treatment option(s)
* The implementation status of necessary controls
* The reasons for selection of treatment options, including expected benefits to be gained
* Proposed actions including responsible individuals, timeframes, and schedule
* Resource requirements including contingencies
* Performance measures and constraints
* Reporting and monitoring

While the residual risk is related to the risk treatment process, it is not explicitly included in the risk treatment plan itself. The residual risk is the remaining risk after treatment actions are applied and needs to be evaluated similarly to the initial process to see if it falls into the acceptable category. If it does not, new treatment should be decided.

---

### Question 26
*What does restricting alteration of information to only authorised persons refer to?*

- a) Availability
- b) Non repudiation
- c) Confidentiality
- d) **Integrity**

**Correct Answer:** d) Integrity

*Explanation:* Restricting alteration of information to only authorised persons refers to **integrity**. 

*   **Integrity** ensures the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle, and that data cannot be modified in an unauthorised or undetected manner.
*   The other options are not correct:
    *   **Availability** means making systems available to authorised users when they need it.
     *   **Confidentiality** means that information is not disclosed to unauthorised individuals.
    *   **Non-repudiation** is not explicitly defined in the sources.

---

### Question 27
*Regarding resources, ISO/ IEC 27001 requires organisations to ensure?*

- a) **They are available to operate the ISMS without interruption**
- b) Annual budget is allocated to the ISMS
- c) Providing 24hr support
- d) They are cost effective

**Correct Answer:** a) They are available to operate the ISMS without interruption

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **a) They are available to operate the ISMS without interruption**.

While the other options might be helpful for a well-resourced ISMS, they are not explicitly required by the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.

Here's why:
*   **ISO/IEC 27001 mandates that organisations determine and provide the resources** needed for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the ISMS. These resources include people, skills, infrastructure, technology, information, and finances.
*   Auditors are tasked with confirming that the organisation anticipates, determines, and allocates the necessary resources for the ISMS.
*   The standard does not specify that resources must be available without interruption, that an annual budget is allocated, that 24hr support must be provided or that they be cost effective, though these might be necessary to ensure the ISMS functions effectively.

Therefore, while options b), c) and d) could contribute to a robust ISMS, option a) best reflects the core requirement of the standard regarding resource availability for operating the ISMS.

---

### Question 28
*What is NOT a risk treatment option*

- a) Acceptance
- b) Mitigation
- c) Transfer
- d) **Ignore**

**Correct Answer:** d) Ignore

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) Ignore**.

According to the sources, risk treatment options include:
*   **Avoiding** the risk
*   **Controlling** the risk and reducing the risk level, which is also referred to as **mitigation**
*   **Transferring** the risk
*   **Accepting** the risk
*   A combination of the above options

The sources do not include "ignore" as a valid risk treatment option.

---

### Question 29
*ISO 27001 requires that companies continually improve*

- a) The work environment of IT security employees
- b) **The effectiveness of the Information Security Management System**
- c) The quality of manufactures products
- d) The business processes

**Correct Answer:** b) The effectiveness of the Information Security Management System

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **b) The effectiveness of the Information Security Management System**.

ISO/IEC 27001 requires that organisations **continually improve** the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the ISMS. This means that the organisation should be working to enhance the ISMS, making it better at achieving its objectives, and ensuring that it remains appropriate for the organisation's needs.

The standard does not explicitly require organisations to continually improve:
*   The work environment of IT security employees
*   The quality of manufactured products
*   The business processes

While these other options may be related to or impacted by the ISMS, they are not the specific focus of the continual improvement requirement in ISO/IEC 27001.

The focus of continual improvement within ISO 27001 is on enhancing the ISMS itself through activities such as:
*   Taking actions to address risks and opportunities.
*   Establishing objectives.
*   Upgrading operational controls.
*   Analysing and evaluating performance.
*   Conducting internal audits and management reviews.
*   Detecting nonconformities and implementing corrective actions.
*   Periodically evaluating and reviewing the ISMS to identify opportunities for improvement.

---

### Question 30
*What is true about an Information Security Management System?*

- a) A set of policies, procedures and practices
- b) Uses Risk Management process
- c) A systematic approach
- d) **All of the above**

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the above

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) All of the above**.

Here's why:
*   An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is indeed **a set of policies, procedures, and practices**. These elements provide a framework for managing and protecting an organisation's information assets.
*   An ISMS **uses a risk management process**. This involves identifying, assessing, and treating risks to information security. Risk management is central to the operation of an ISMS, ensuring that controls are implemented appropriately to address identified threats.
*   An ISMS is a **systematic approach**. It is a structured framework for managing information security, and it is not ad-hoc or haphazard. The ISMS is designed to be a part of an organisation's overall management system. It follows a plan-do-check-act cycle, or other improvement models, to ensure that the ISMS is continually being improved.

Therefore, all of the options are true about an Information Security Management System. It is a structured framework comprised of policies, procedures and practices that follows a systematic approach based on a risk management process.

### Question 31
*Employees working within the ISMS should be aware of?*

- a) The budget allocated to the ISMS
- b) The required certifications to do their job
- c) **The implications of not conforming to the ISMS requirements**
- d) The date of internal audit

**Correct Answer:** c) The implications of not conforming to the ISMS requirements

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **c) The implications of not conforming to the ISMS requirements**.

According to the sources, personnel working under the organisation's control should be aware of:
*   **The information security policy**.
*   Their contribution to the effectiveness of the information security management system (ISMS), including the benefits of improved information security performance.
*   **The implications of not conforming with the information security management system requirements**.

The sources do not state that employees working within the ISMS should be specifically aware of:
*   The budget allocated to the ISMS.
*   The required certifications to do their job.
*   The date of the internal audit.

While these may be relevant to some employees or to the overall management of the ISMS, they are not explicitly mentioned as awareness requirements in the standard.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer, based on the information in the sources, is that employees working within the ISMS should be aware of the implications of not conforming to the ISMS requirements.

---

### Question 32
*The policies for information security need to be reviewed at planned intervals, or if significant changes occur, to ensure their continuing?*

- a) Suitability
- b) Adequacy
- c) Effectiveness
- d) **All of the above**

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the above

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) All of the above**.

According to the sources, the policies for information security should be reviewed at planned intervals or when significant changes occur to ensure their continuing:
*   **Suitability**: This means that the policies should still be appropriate for the organisation's purpose and context. They should align with the organisation's goals and risk appetite.
*   **Adequacy**: This refers to whether the policies are comprehensive enough to address the organisation's information security needs. The policies should cover all relevant areas and provide sufficient guidance.
*   **Effectiveness**: This means that the policies should be achieving their intended outcomes. They should be effective in protecting the organisation's information assets and mitigating risks.

The review process should take into account changes to:
*   The business environment.
*   Legal requirements.
*   Technology.
*   The internal organisation.

The review should also include assessing opportunities for improvement.

Therefore, the policies for information security need to be reviewed to ensure that they remain suitable, adequate, and effective, making "All of the above" the correct option.

---

### Question 33
*What is a vulnerability?*

- a) A potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation
- b) **A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats**
- c) The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability
- d) The probability of the happening of a bad event

**Correct Answer:** b) A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **b) A weakness of an asset or a resource that can be exploited by one or more threats**.

Here's why:
*   A **vulnerability** is defined as a weakness that can be used to harm an information asset.
*   A **threat** is defined as anything that can harm an information asset.
*   A **risk** is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives.
*   Risk is also defined as the likelihood of something happening.

Therefore, a vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit, which can then result in risk or impact to the organisation.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:
*   Option a) "A potential cause which may harm a system or an organisation" is the definition of a **threat**.
*   Option c) "The potential of a loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability" describes the **impact** of a risk, or a security event.
*  Option d) "The probability of the happening of a bad event" refers to the **likelihood** of an event, which is also a key component of **risk**.

In summary, a **vulnerability** is a specific weakness that a **threat** can exploit, leading to a potential **risk** with a certain **impact** and **likelihood**.

### Question 34
*Information must be classified in terms of all the following except one*

- a) Legal Requirements
- b) Value
- c) Criticality
- d) **Complexity**

**Correct Answer:** d) Complexity

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) Complexity**.

According to the sources, information needs to be classified taking into consideration:
*   **Legal requirements**
*   **Value** of the information
*   **Criticality** and sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure or modification.
*   The level of protection needed to ensure the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information.
*   Relevant **interested party requirements**

The sources do not mention **complexity** as a factor for classifying information.

Therefore, while legal requirements, value, and criticality are all valid criteria for information classification, complexity is not. Hence, complexity is the exception.

### Question 35
*The organisation should provide metrics for the ISMS performance regarding?*

- a) The number of risks
- b) The IT security employees turnover
- c) The increase of threats
- d) **The compliance with the standard**

**Correct Answer:** d) The compliance with the standard

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) The compliance with the standard**.

Here's why:
*   The organisation is required to **monitor, measure, analyse and evaluate** its information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS. This includes determining what needs to be monitored and measured, the methods for doing so, and when the results should be analysed and evaluated.
*   The sources state that the organisation should evaluate its information security performance. This performance can be measured against the **organisation's objectives**, the effectiveness of its **controls**, the degree to which **risks are being addressed** and its **compliance with the standard**.
*  **Metrics should be used to drive continual improvement** of the ISMS.

The sources also provide examples of what can be monitored and measured which include:
*   Information security events and how many of them became information security incidents.
*   The accomplishment of information security objectives.
*   Reported security vulnerabilities.

While the number of risks, IT security employees turnover, and increase of threats are all potentially relevant to the ISMS, they are not explicitly stated as the primary focus for metrics of ISMS performance.

Therefore, the most suitable option is that the organisation should provide metrics for the ISMS performance regarding **compliance with the standard**, as well as considering whether the ISMS is meeting its objectives and addressing identified risks.

### Question 36
*What is NOT true about ISO/IEC 27001 Internal Audit?*

- a) Performed at planned intervals
- b) Auditors should be independent
- c) Audit program should be documented
- d) **Audit should be performed by internal auditors**

**Correct Answer:** d) Audit should be performed by internal auditors

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) Audit should be performed by internal auditors**.

Here's why:
*   **Internal audits must be conducted at planned intervals**. The internal audit programme should consider the importance of the processes concerned and the results of previous audits.
*   **Auditors should be objective and impartial**. Auditors should be independent from the activities being audited.
*   **An audit programme should be planned, established, implemented, and maintained**. This programme should include the frequency, methods, responsibilities, planning requirements and reporting of audits. Documented information must be available as evidence of the implementation of the audit programme and the audit results.
*   While the standard requires internal audits, it does not specify that they **must** be performed by internal personnel. Internal audits can also be managed by **external persons acting on the organization's behalf**. The selection of persons responsible for managing the internal audit programme and the auditors who conduct the internal audits must meet competence requirements and guidelines.

Therefore, while the other options are true of an ISO/IEC 27001 internal audit, it is **not** a requirement that the audit is performed by internal auditors, as external personnel may also be used.

### Question 37
*What is a control of compliance in the Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard?*

- a) Privacy & Protection of Personally Identifiable Information
- b) Intellectual Property Rights
- c) Protection of Records
- d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the above

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) All of the above**.

Here's why:
*   The standard indicates that **Annex A of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard contains a list of possible information security controls**. These controls are not exhaustive, and organisations may identify controls from any source.
*   The controls are grouped into four categories: **Organisational, People, Physical and Technological controls**.
*   The sources list **Privacy and Protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **Intellectual Property Rights**, and **Protection of Records** as specific controls within Annex A of the standard. These are all part of the Organisational controls.
*   **Privacy and Protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is a control that requires the organisation to identify and meet the requirements regarding the preservation of privacy and protection of PII according to applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements.
*   **Intellectual Property Rights** is a control that requires the organisation to implement appropriate procedures to protect intellectual property rights. These rights can include software or document copyrights, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licenses.
*   **Protection of Records** is a control that requires records to be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorised access and unauthorised release. 'Records' are documented individual events or transactions that evidence business activity.

Therefore, all of the options - Privacy & Protection of Personally Identifiable Information, Intellectual Property Rights, and Protection of Records - are controls related to compliance found within Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard.

### Question 38
*When determining the scope of the ISMS which of the following need to be considered?*

- a) Organisational Roles & Responsibilities
- b) Leadership and Commitment
- c) Threats and Vulnerabilities
- d) **External and Internal Issues**

**Correct Answer:** d) External and Internal Issues

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) External and Internal Issues**.

Here's why:

*   When determining the scope of the Information Security Management System (ISMS), the organisation **must** consider **external and internal issues** that are relevant to its purpose and that affect its ability to achieve the intended outcomes of the ISMS.
*   The organisation must also consider the **requirements of relevant interested parties**.
*   Additionally, the **interfaces and dependencies** between the organisation's activities and those performed by other organisations should be taken into account when determining the scope.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:
*   **Organisational Roles & Responsibilities** are important for the implementation and maintenance of the ISMS, and these should be defined and communicated. However, they are not specifically required when defining the scope of the ISMS.
*  **Leadership and Commitment** from top management are also crucial for the success of the ISMS. However, this is a separate aspect of the standard and not a direct factor in determining the ISMS scope.
*  **Threats and Vulnerabilities** are key factors in the risk assessment process. While risk assessment is a crucial element of the ISMS, it is not a direct factor to consider when defining the scope of the ISMS. **The risk assessment process is informed by the scope**, but the scope is not directly determined by the threats and vulnerabilities themselves.

In summary, **external and internal issues**, the **requirements of interested parties**, and **interfaces and dependencies** are the factors that should be directly considered when determining the scope of the ISMS.

### Question 39
*What does the organisation need to consider when determining the ISMS scope?*

- a) The Internal Issues
- b) The requirements of Interested Parties
- c) The External Issues
- d) **All of the above**

**Correct Answer:** d) All of the above.

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **d) All of the above**.

Here's why:

*   When defining the scope of the Information Security Management System (ISMS), the organisation is required to consider **both external and internal issues** that are relevant to its purpose and that could affect its ability to achieve the intended outcomes of the ISMS.
*   The organisation must also take into account the **requirements of relevant interested parties**. These requirements may include legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
*   The organisation should also consider the **interfaces and dependencies between its activities and those performed by other organisations**, such as suppliers and subcontractors.
*   These considerations help to define the boundaries and applicability of the ISMS, ensuring that all relevant areas are included within its scope.

Therefore, the ISMS scope should be determined based on:

*   **Internal issues**, such as the organisation's governance, structure, policies, capabilities, and culture.
*   **External issues**, such as the legal, regulatory, cultural, social, financial, technological, economic, and competitive environments.
*  **The requirements of interested parties**, including legal authorities, clients, contractors, employees, and other stakeholders.

By considering all of these factors, the organisation can establish a scope that is appropriate for its context and that effectively addresses its information security risks.

### Question 40
*What is the purpose of ISO 27001?*

- a) **Providing the requirements of the ISMS development and operation**
- b) Providing guidelines on information security risk management
- c) Providing information security management system measurement
- d) Providing guidelines for Information Security Management Systems Auditing

**Correct Answer:** a) Providing the requirements of the ISMS development and operation

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **a) Providing the requirements of the ISMS development and operation**.

Here's why:

*   **ISO/IEC 27001** is the standard that **specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS)**. It provides a framework for organisations to manage their information security effectively.
*   The standard outlines what an organisation must do to set up and operate its ISMS. It **provides requirements** for the scope of the ISMS, policies, risk assessments, risk treatment, objectives, and other aspects of managing information security.
*  The **ISO 27000 family of standards** has multiple documents, each serving a different purpose:
    *   **ISO/IEC 27002** provides guidelines for implementing the controls in Annex A.
    *   **ISO/IEC 27003** provides general guidance for the implementation of an ISMS.
    *  **ISO/IEC 27004** offers advice on monitoring and measuring ISMS performance.
    *   **ISO/IEC 27005** provides guidance on risk management.
    *   **ISO/IEC 27007** provides guidelines for auditing an ISMS.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:
*   Option b) "Providing guidelines on information security risk management" - While risk management is a key part of ISO 27001, the standard itself **provides requirements for how risk management should be approached, not just guidelines**. ISO/IEC 27005 is the standard that provides guidelines on information security risk management.
*   Option c) "Providing information security management system measurement" - ISO 27001 does **specify that an ISMS's performance needs to be measured**, but it does not provide detailed guidelines for that. **ISO/IEC 27004** provides advice on how organisations can monitor and measure the performance of their ISMS.
*   Option d) "Providing guidelines for Information Security Management Systems Auditing" - While ISO 27001 does require internal audits, it does not provide specific guidelines for auditing the ISMS. **ISO/IEC 27007** provides guidelines for auditing an ISMS.

In summary, while other standards in the ISO 27000 family provide guidance, ISO 27001 itself is focused on **setting the requirements for establishing and operating the ISMS**.

### Question 41
*Which of the following is an external issue that can affect the scope of ISMS?*

- a) Risk Appetite
- b) **Government Regulations**
- c) Processes and Practices
- d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** b) Government Regulations

*Explanation:* The correct answer is **b) Government Regulations**.

Here's why:

*   When determining the scope of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), an organisation must consider both **external and internal issues** that are relevant to its purpose and that affect its ability to achieve the intended outcomes of its ISMS.
*   **External issues** refer to factors outside the organisation that can impact its ISMS. These can include:
    *   **Government regulations** and legislation.
    *   The social and cultural context.
    *   The financial, economic, and political landscape.
    *   Competition and market forces.
    *   Trends in information security.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:

*   **a) Risk Appetite**: Risk appetite is an **internal** factor that influences how much risk an organisation is willing to take. It's a part of the organisation's internal context rather than an external issue.
*   **c) Processes and Practices**: These are also **internal** aspects of an organisation. They describe how the organisation operates and are part of the internal context of the ISMS.

Therefore, of the options provided, **government regulations** is the only one that is an external issue that can affect the scope of an ISMS.
