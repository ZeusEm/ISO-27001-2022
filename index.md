## Foundation Exam - Question Bank

### Question 1
*Anything that has value to the organization is known as?*

- a) CISO
- b) **Asset**
- c) Network
- d) Money

**Correct Answer:** b) Asset

*Explanation:* Anything that has value to the organization is considered an **asset**. Information is also considered an asset that drives business in today's networked environment.

Assets can include:
*   Software such as Windows and Oracle
*   Paper documents such as contracts and telephone lists
*   Supporting utilities such as VOIP, telephone, and backup power supply
*   Hardware such as servers, laptops, and PDAs
*   People such as HR managers and network engineers
*   Information such as voice messages

Utilities themselves do not carry information, but they support devices that do. Information can be static (e.g., stored on a hard disk) or being transmitted (e.g., via email). Whatever form the information takes, it must always be protected.

Access to assets should be authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements. An inventory of assets, including their owners, should be developed and maintained. The term ‘owner’ refers to the individual or entity with management responsibility for controlling the asset's security, use, development, and maintenance. The owner approves the risk level and the controls selected for protecting that asset.

### Question 2
*Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity:*

- a) Confidentiality
- b) Integrity
- c) Accountability
- d) **Availability**

**Correct Answer:** d) Availability

*Explanation:* The property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity is **availability**.

Availability is one of the three types of protection for information security, the others being confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Confidentiality** ensures that information is only accessed by those with a "need to know" and "need to do".
*   **Integrity** refers to the "accuracy" and "completeness" of information. It means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
*   **Availability** means that systems are accessible to authorised users when needed. This includes ensuring that computing systems that process information and the communication channels through which the information is sent are working correctly.

These three aspects are vital for business survival, as is the identification of information security requirements.

### Question 3
*Set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to establish policies and objectives and processes to achieve those objectives:*

- a) ISMS objective
- b) Policy statement
- c) **Management System**
- d) Statement of Applicability

**Correct Answer:** c) Management System (References/1)

*Explanation:* Based on the standard:

*   **a) ISMS objective:** An ISMS (Information Security Management System) objective is a desired outcome or goal related to information security that an organisation sets for itself. Objectives should be consistent with the information security policy, measurable, and take into account applicable requirements as well as results from risk assessment and risk treatment. **While ISMS objectives are a crucial component of the ISMS, they are not the entire set of interrelated or interacting elements themselves**. Objectives are what an ISMS aims to achieve.

*   **b) Policy statement**: A policy statement, specifically an information security policy, provides a framework for setting information security objectives and includes a commitment to satisfy requirements and to continually improve the ISMS. The policy is a documented information, communicated within the organization and available to interested parties. **A policy statement is an important part of a management system, but it does not encompass all the interacting elements needed to establish and achieve objectives**. It provides direction and commitment, but not the processes for implementation.

*   **c) Management System:** A management system is a framework of guidelines, policies, procedures, processes and associated resources aimed at ensuring an organisation meets its objectives. An ISMS is a type of management system that focuses specifically on information security. The ISMS includes processes and their interactions to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve information security within an organization.  **This is the most accurate answer, as a management system is indeed a framework of interacting elements designed to achieve objectives through policies and processes**.

    *   Key components of a management system include:
        *   **Policies:** Providing the direction and framework.
        *   **Objectives:** Defining what the organization aims to achieve.
        *   **Processes:** The activities and procedures to reach the objectives.
        *   **Resources:** What is needed to implement the processes.
        *  **Interactions:** The relationships between the various processes and elements.
        *   **Continual Improvement:** Regular monitoring and adjustments to ensure effectiveness.
        *   **Documentation:**  To ensure consistency and clarity.

*  **d) Statement of Applicability (SOA):** The SOA is a documented statement describing the control objectives and controls that are relevant and applicable to the organisation's ISMS. It includes the necessary controls, justifications for their inclusion, whether they are implemented, and justification for excluding any Annex A controls. The SOA is derived from the risk treatment process. **The SOA is a key document within an ISMS, but it's a result of the ISMS processes, not the complete set of interacting elements itself**. The SOA reflects the implementation of controls but not the framework that defines how these controls are chosen and managed.

**Therefore, the most accurate answer is c) Management System, as this term most closely describes the set of interrelated or interacting elements designed to establish policies, objectives, and processes to achieve those objectives within an organisation.** The other options represent important components of the ISMS, but not the entire framework of interacting elements themselves.

### Question 4
*Non-fulfilment of a requirement is:*

- a) **Non-conformity**
- b) Non-repudiation
- c) Requirement
- d) Risk

**Correct Answer:** a) Non-conformity

*Explanation:* Non-fulfilment of a requirement is a **non-conformity**.

The standard describes nonconformity and its management within the context of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) as below:
*   When a nonconformity occurs, the organization must react to it, taking action to control and correct it and deal with the consequences.
*   The organization must evaluate the need for action to eliminate the causes of the nonconformity, reviewing the nonconformity, determining its causes, and determining if similar nonconformities exist or could potentially occur.
*   The organisation must implement any necessary actions, review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken, and make changes to the ISMS if necessary.
*   Corrective actions should be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.
*   Documented information should be available as evidence of the nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken, and the results of any corrective action.
*   Auditors should confirm that the organisation responds by finding nonconformity and requiring corrective action when ISO/IEC 27001 and ISMS requirements are not satisfied.
*   Nonconformity and corrective action includes taking action to correct the situation, examine the cause, and determine if other occurrences exist or potentially exist elsewhere, so that action can be taken to prevent recurrence.
*   The organisation’s response should cover evaluation of the action taken to confirm that the intended result was achieved, and evaluation of the ISMS to determine if changes are warranted to avoid future occurrences of similar nonconformities.
*   Documentation of the nonconformity, corrective action, and the results should be created and controlled in accordance with the requirements of documented information.
*   Nonconformities should be managed with corrections and corrective actions.

Other terms in the question mentioned:
*   **Non-repudiation** In law, non-repudiation is a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated"
*  A **requirement** is a need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory. It may be a business, legal, security or other kind of requirement. 
*   A **risk** is the effect of uncertainty on objectives and can be positive or negative. Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the likelihood of an event and its consequences.
